summary: UDP socket. 
description: |
    Most socket operations are asynchronous. When you create a socket, you can define
    callback funtions to receive the results of API calls, as well as to handle incoming
    data.

    For example, for a client-side socket, you define 
    [started](Titanium.Network.Socket.UDP.started) and
    [error](Titanium.Network.Socket.UDP.error) callback functions.
    
    A familiarity with the basics of BSD socket programming is a recommended before using 
    sockets with Titanium.

    Use the <Titanium.Network.Socket.createUDP> method to create a UDP socket.

                    socket.sendString(e.port, e.address, "Hello, World!");

                data: function (e) {
                    alert(e.stringData);
                    Ti.API.info('Socket received data: ' + e.stringData);
                    Ti.API.info('bytes: ' + e.bytesData.length);
                    Ti.API.info('address: ' + e.address);
                    Ti.API.info('port: ' + e.port);
                },
